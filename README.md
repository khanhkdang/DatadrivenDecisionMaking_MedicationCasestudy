MEDICATION CASE STUDY

The case study focuses on reducing in-hospital waste of compounded medication.

One of the functions performed by in-hospital pharmacies is the custom compounding of medication both for inpatients and outpatients. 

The compounded medication are stable for a short time, they are manufactured in powder or concentrate form and need to be custom compouned prior to being administered to a patient.

The process is less efficient in planning, communicating, and dispensing of CSP result in wastage of medication (annual waste of 47 thousand doses, and more than half a million dollars)

Goals: Propose new compounded sterile medications (CSP) preparation batches, reduce errors in delivery, reduce waste disposal, minimize communicaion gap

Stakeholders: Patients, Pharmacist, Health Care Provider, Technicians

Analysis of time of dose, cancellation, medication confirmation and drug ID

Action Plans: New Batches Model, Medical Waste Disposal, Smart Cart Dispensing, CPOE system, Label Genneration, Training Staff.
