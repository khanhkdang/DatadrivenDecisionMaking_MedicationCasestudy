# MEDICATION CASE STUDY

The case study focuses on reducing in-hospital waste of Compounded Sterile Medication.

One of the functions performed by in-hospital pharmacies is the custom compounding of medication both for in patients and out patients.

The compounded medication are stable for a short time, need to be custom compounded before administered to a patient.

The current process is less efficient in planning, communicating, and dispensing of CSP result in wastage of medication (annual waste of 47 thousand doses, and more than half a million dollars)

Goals: Propose a new model which reduce errors in delivery, reduce waste disposal, minimize communication gap and optimized schedule of CSP preparation batches

Stakeholders: Patients, Pharmacist, Health Care Provider, Technicians

Analysis of time of dose, cancellation, medication confirmation and drug ID

Action Plans: New Batches Model, Medical Waste Disposal, Smart Cart Dispensing, CPOE system, Label Generation, Training Staff.
